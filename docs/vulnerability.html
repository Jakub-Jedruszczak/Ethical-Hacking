                In this video we will talk about cross-site scripting:<br>
                <br>
                Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a common injection vulnerability in web development which occurs due to a lack of sanitisation. Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities happen when unsanitised inputs can be used to exectute JavaScript code on the victim's browser. This could allow a malicious actor to attack a victim through a trusted website.<br>
                <br>
                The main three types of XSS are Reflected XSS, in which the link the user clicks contains injected code; Stored XSS, where a page a user retrieves from a database (i.e. a post) contains an injection; and Document Object Model (DOM) XSS, where the injection is used to modify the browser's environment.
                XSS can be used to bypass authentication policies, download malware, or execute code on the browser. Because of these risks, it is essential to sanitise special characters out of user input.</p>

             <br>
             <p>Stored XSS, also known as Persistent XSS, is a type of Cross Site Scripting attack where the attacker
                saves data on a server where that data will be processed in an untrusted way. Stored XSS can 
                be very impactful as the malicious code will execute every time the data is loaded. </p>
                <p>For example, if a video-publishing website allows users to comment on videos doesn’t sanitise 
                    (removing or converting code and special characters into ordinary, non-executable text) the comment 
                    contents, stored XSS can occur.  </p>
                    <br>
                <p>This means that any user who opens the page with the comment could potentially have malicious code 
                    executed on their web browser. As victim users will not know if the comments on a video will be 
                    malicious without loading the video’s webpage, this can be especially effective. 
                    Unlike reflected XSS, the attacks are usually self-contained, without the attacker
                    having to use social engineering (tricking or persuading a user into carrying out 
                    an action that will aid the attacker) to make users enter JavaScript code. This 
                    greatly increases the success rate of these attacks, since they do not rely on 
                    very naïve victims who would have to follow a suspicious link, instead catching 
                    users by surprise as they often do not have to do anything at all to be hacked. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 stlye = "font-size: 30px;"><u>Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)</u></h3>
                <br>
                <p>Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of Cross Site Scripting which relies 
                    on software engineering (An attack trying to trick a victim into trusting the attacker, 
                    often relying on their curiosity, i.e., a victim plugging in a USB they found on the floor) 
                    a target to click a link to a trusted website but with a malicious payload. Reflected XSS is 
                    possible when user input is rendered (The process of generating HTML elements to show to the user. 
                    JavaScript code is rendered by executing it on the browser) by the website without sanitising 
                    (Clearing unwanted parts of user input, such as special characters or malicious code) it beforehand. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are many ways an attacker might perform or deliver a Reflected XSS attack; an attacker could email 
                        the link as part of a phishing scam, as a QR code or on a mass messaging site such as Twitter.
                         While this attack more effective to use when targeting a specific victim, it can be just as 
                         easily used for indiscriminate attacks. 
                        <br>
                        Let’s look at an example – take a website with a search bar which outputs the name of the 
                        searched item as well as the results. After submitting the search query, the URL of the website may change to: <br>
                        <br></p>
                        <p>http://example.com/search?term=item</p> 
                        <br>
                        <p>Assuming the website does not sanitise user input, an attacker could enter malicious code which then will be injected 
                            into the webpage, which then would be rendered and executed as code. An attacker could do this using the search bar 
                            or by entering a URL as shown in the example below. </p>
                            <br>
                            <xmp>https://example.com/search?term=<script>malicious code here</script></xmp> 
                            <br>
                            <p>Entering this URL would result in the following response: </p>
                            <br>
                            <xmp><p>Showing results for: <script>malicious code here</script></p> </xmp>
                            <br>
                            <p>As you can see, the code entered by the user will be placed and executed on the website whenever the link is followed. 
                            This is dangerous since malicious code running on the browser can perform many actions such as stealing login cookies, 
                            view user information, modify user information, and generally perform any action the user can perform on the website. </p>
                            <br>
                            
                            <h3 stlye = "font-size: 30px;"><u>Document Object Model Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</u></h3>
                            <br>
                            <p>Document Object Model Cross Site Scripting, known as DOM XSS for short, is a type of Cross Site Scripting that uses the
                            website’s Document Object Model (A representation of the hierarchical structure of the page, used by JavaScript to manipulate 
                            objects and elements of the page) to execute malicious code by manipulating the structure of the website, allowing for arbitrary 
                            JavaScript execution.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>DOM-based XSS attacks need the injection to pass through an unsanitised source (A JavaScript or HTML element which accepts data
                                which can potentially be controlled by the attacker; examples include the URL, accessed through the document.referrer property 
                                and the location.search property) and be executed by a sink (A function which can potentially execute malicious payloads 
                                supplied<br>
                                <br>
                                through the source by an attacker1. Examples include eval() and document.body.innerHTML), where the structure of the website is 
                                changed by the attacker. The most common source is the URL, which is typically accessed with the location object. An attacker can 
                                construct a link to send a victim to a vulnerable page with a payload in the query string and fragment portions of the URL. 
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>DOM XSS vulnerabilities can be found manually by entering data into a source element – such as a search bar – and finding out where 
                                    the data ends up on the page – i.e., which sink it was used by. This process can be hastened using tools such as Chrome’s developer 
                                    tools, or fully automated using Burpsuite. </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>While DOM XSS allows potentially a much larger attack surface, finding sources and their corresponding sinks can prove difficult. 
                                        For example, you might find a very vulnerable sink such as document.write or element.innerHTML which work with script elements; 
                                        however, you may have a problem with finding a source which you could use to funnel your injection into. In practice, different 
                                        sources and sinks have different protections and behaviours which can affect exploitability and determine which techniques an 
                                        attacker has to use. The page's scripts might perform validation, sanitisation or other processing of data that must be bypassed 
                                        when attempting to exploit a vulnerability. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        DOM XSS can be combined with both Reflected and Stored Cross Site Scripting, allowing an attacker to target a specific user or send 
                                        the attack indiscriminately. <br>
