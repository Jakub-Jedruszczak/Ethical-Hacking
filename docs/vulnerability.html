                <br>
                In this video we will talk about cross-site scripting:<br>
                <br>
                Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a common injection vulnerability in web development which occurs due to a lack of sanitisation. Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities happen when unsanitised inputs can be used to exectute JavaScript code on the victim's browser. This could allow a malicious actor to attack a victim through a trusted website.<br>
                <br>
                The main three types of XSS are Reflected XSS, in which the link the user clicks contains injected code; Stored XSS, where a page a user retrieves from a database (i.e. a post) contains an injection; and Document Object Model (DOM) XSS, where the injection is used to modify the browser's environment.
                XSS can be used to bypass authentication policies, download malware, or execute code on the browser. Because of these risks, it is essential to sanitise special characters out of user input.</p>   
            </div>
        <div class = "blog">
            <h1 class = "footer_header" style = "text-align: left;">Reflected Cross Site Scripting</h1>
            Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of Cross Site Scripting which relies on <a class = "tooltip">software engineering <span>An attack trying to trick a victim into trusting the attacker, often relying on their curiosity, i.e., a victim plugging in a USB they found on the floor</span></a> a target to click a link to a trusted website but with a malicious payload. Reflected XSS is possible when user input is <a class = "tooltip"> rendered <span>The process of generating HTML elements to show to the user. JavaScript code is rendered by executing it on the browser</span></a> by the website without <a class = "tooltip"> sanitising <span>clearing unwanted parts of user input, such as special characters or malicious code</span></a> it beforehand.  
            <br>
            There are many ways an attacker might perform or deliver a Reflected XSS attack; an attacker could email the link as part of a phishing scam, as a QR code or on a mass messaging site such as Twitter<a class = "tooltip">[1]<span>source: Arthur, C. (2010). The Twitter hack: how it started and how it worked. The Guardian. [online] 21 Sep. [Accessed 4 May 2023] </span></a>. While this attack more effective to use when targeting a specific victim, it can be just as easily used for indiscriminate attacks. 
            <br>
            Let’s look at an example – take a website with a search bar which outputs the name of the searched item as well as the results. After submitting the search query, the URL of the website may change to: 
            <br>
            <code class = "code-scrollable">http://example.com/search?term=item</code>
            <br>
            The item searched for on the website would then be echoed on the website as shown below. 
            <br>
            <code class = "code-scrollable">&lt;p&gt;Showing results for: item&lt;/p&gt; </code>
            <br>
            Assuming the website does not sanitise user input, an attacker could enter malicious code which then will be injected into the webpage, which then would be rendered and executed as code. An attacker could do this using the search bar or by entering a URL as shown in the example below. 
            <br>
            <code class = "code-scrollable">https://example.com/search?term=&lt;script&gt;malicious code here&lt;/script&gt; </code>
            <br>
            Entering this URL would result in the following response: 
            <br>
            <code class = "code-scrollable">&lt;p&gt;Showing results for: &lt;script&gt;malicious code here&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>
            <br>
            As you can see, the code entered by the user will be placed and executed on the website whenever the link is followed. This is dangerous since malicious code running on the browser can perform many actions such as stealing login cookies, view user information, modify user information, and generally perform any action the user can perform on the website.

            <h1 class = "footer_header" style = "text-align: left;">Stored Cross Site Scripting</h1>
            <br><br>
            Stored XSS, also known as Persistent XSS, is a type of Cross Site Scripting attack where the attacker saves data on a server where that data will be processed in an untrusted way. Stored XSS can be very impactful as the malicious code will execute every time the data is loaded. 
            <br><br>
            For example, if a video-publishing website allows users to comment on videos doesn’t <a class = "tooltip">sanitise <span>removing or converting code and special characters into ordinary, non-executable text</span></a> the comment contents, stored XSS can occur.  
            <br><br>
            This means that any user who opens the page with the comment could potentially have malicious code executed on their web browser. As victim users will not know if the comments on a video will be malicious without loading the video’s webpage, this can be especially effective. 
            <br><br>
            Unlike reflected XSS, the attacks are usually self-contained, without the attacker having to use <a class = "tooltip">social engineering <span> tricking or persuading a user into carrying out an action that will aid the attacker</span></a> to make users enter JavaScript code. This greatly increases the success rate of these attacks, since they do not rely on very naïve victims who would have to follow a suspicious link, instead catching users by surprise as they often do not have to do anything at all to be hacked. 
            <br><br>
            <h1 class = "footer_header" style = "text-align: left;">Document Object Model (DOM) Cross Site Scripting</h1>
            Document Object Model Cross Site Scripting, known as DOM XSS for short, is a type of Cross Site Scripting that uses the website’s <a class="tooltip">
                Document Object Model<span>A representation of the hierarchical structure of the page, used by JavaScript to manipulate objects and elements of the page</span></a>
                 to execute malicious code by manipulating the structure of the website, allowing for arbitrary JavaScript execution.<br><br>
              DOM-based XSS attacks need the injection to pass through an unsanitised 
              <a class = "tooltip">source<span>A JavaScript or HTML element which accepts data which can potentially be controlled by the attacker; examples include the URL, accessed through the document.referrer property and the location.search property
              </span></a>
               and be executed by a 
               <a class = "tooltip">sink<span>
                A function which can potentially execute malicious payloads supplied through the source by an attacker. Examples include eval() and document.body.innerHTML</span></a>,
               where the structure of the website is changed by the attacker. The most common source is the URL, which is typically accessed with the location object. An attacker can construct a link to send a victim to a vulnerable page with a payload in the function's query.
               <br><br>
               DOM XSS vulnerabilities can be found manually by entering data into a source element – such as a search bar – and finding out where the data ends up on the page – i.e., which sink it was used by. This process can be hastened using tools such as Chrome’s developer tools, or fully automated using Burpsuite. 
              <br><br>
              While DOM XSS allows potentially a much larger attack surface, finding sources and their corresponding sinks can prove difficult. For example, you might find a very vulnerable sink such as document.write or element.innerHTML which work with script elements; however, you may have a problem with finding a source which you could use to funnel your injection into. In practice, different sources and sinks have different protections and behaviours which can affect exploitability and determine which techniques an attacker has to use. The page's scripts might perform validation, sanitisation or other processing of data that must be bypassed when attempting to exploit a vulnerability. 
              <br><br>
              DOM XSS can be combined with both Reflected and Stored Cross Site Scripting, allowing an attacker to target a specific user or send the attack indiscriminately.
